# basic-chat-application
This is a basic client-server chat application
I used sockets to create a connection between the server and clients. Currently this only supports connections in the local area network(LAN)/wifi
To use, the server-side code should be running, then the client-side code can run to connect. 
Make sure to add the ip-address of the server computer to the client-side code. 

Currently supports multiple clients.
